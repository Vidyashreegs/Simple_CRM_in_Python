# Simple_CRM_in_Python
My first project in Python
This project presents the development of a Python-based Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system, inspired by over six years of hands-on experience working with leading CRM platforms. Leveraging this extensive expertise, I aim to create a simplified CRM solution that encapsulates fundamental CRM functionalities. The CRM system's primary focus is on three core pillars: Customer Management, Product Cataloging, and Order Processing. These pillars represent the cornerstone of effective business operations, allowing organizations to nurture customer relationships, manage product portfolios, and streamline order fulfillment.

Key Features and Components:

Customer Management: The CRM system will enable businesses to maintain a centralized database of customer information. It will include features for storing contact details, adding and deleting customer profiles. A customer can be a Person or a Company. Customer tab on the application will display list of customers and buttons to add new customer and delete the selected customer.

Product Cataloging: A dedicated module for product management will enable businesses to organize their product inventory efficiently. User can add or remove products from the product catalouge. Products tab on the CRM application will list the products and has buttons to add new products and delete selected product from the list.

Order Processing: The CRM system streamlines the order processing experience with user-friendly functionalities. Users have the capability to choose both the customer and the desired products from a list within the GUI. Subsequently, they can initiate the creation of an order based on their selections. It also has buttons to list orders and delete selected orders from the list.

Although this CRM system encompasses a wide array of features and components, it's essential to recognize that, given our current time constraints, the initial implementation will prioritize customer, product, and order management.
